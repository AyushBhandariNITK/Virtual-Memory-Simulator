# VirtualMemoryManagementSim
A C-Program that simulates Virtual Memory Management based on a text file input of logical addresses which represents sequential instructions with address range 0 thru 2<sup>16</sup> - 1. See the [Project Report](https://github.com/zedtran/VirtualMemoryManagementSim/blob/master/ProjectReport.txt) for more details regarding usage. 

## Overview
This project is the design and implementation of a standalone virtual memory manager, where there is a software-managed TLB. The program is responsible to (1) load a [file](https://github.com/zedtran/VirtualMemoryManagementSim/blob/master/InputFile.txt) containing a list of logical addresses, (2) translate logical addresses into physical addresses for a virtual address space of size 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 bytes, and (3) output the value of the byte stored at the translated physical address.

## Information about the Simulated Virtual Memory
#### 16-bit Logical Addresses
The program reads a file containing a list of 32-bit integer numbers, which represent 32-bit logical addresses. It should be noted that the program only deals with 16-bit addresses. Thus, this simulation implements masking for the rightmost 16 bits of each logical address loaded from the file.


|           Page Number             |             Offset                |
|:---------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|           Bits 15 - 8             |           Bits 7 - 0              |


## System Parameters of the Virtual Memory
The page table size is 2<sup>8</sup> bytes; the TLB contains 16 entries. The page size is 2^8^ bytes, which is the same as the frame size. There are a total of 256 frames in the physical memory, meaning that the total physical memory capability is 65,536 bytes (i.e., 256 frames * 256 bytes/frame). The system parameters of the simulated virtual memory is summarized below.

* Page table size: _2<sup>8</sup>_
* Number of TLB entries: _16_
* Page size: _2<sup>8</sup> bytes_
* Frame size: _2<sup>8</sup> bytes_
* Number of frames: _256_
* Physical memory size: _65,536 bytes_

## How Page Faults are Handled
This virtual memory system implements demand paging. The backing store is simulated by a file called “BACKING_STORE.bin”. BACKING_STORE is a binary file of 65,536 bytes. When a page fault occurs, the virtual memory system will perform the following four steps:

* Step 1: read a 256-byte page from the file BACKING_STORE and
* Step 2: store the loaded page frame in the physical memory.
* Step 3: Update the page table
* Step 4: Update the TLB

For example, if a logical address with page number 15 triggers a page fault, your virtual memory system will read in page 15 from the file BACKING_STORE. Then, the loaded page frame is placed in the physical memory. After the page frame is fetched from the disk, the page table and the TLB will be updated accordingly. Subsequent access of page 15 will be referenced by accessing either the TLB or the page table.

## Compilation and Program Execution

- [ ] ALSO Compiled and tested using gcc: `$ g++ -o vm_sim vm_sim.cpp vmtypes.cpp`
- [ ] Can create a make file and use that but not necessary
- [ ] Execute program with `$ ./vm_sim InputFile.txt` or use an appropriate `[input].txt` file

## Sample Input/Output

#### Upon Running the Program the user will be prompted with the following

```
